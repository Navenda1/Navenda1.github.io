      <p>Hello class of March 2021!</p>      
      <p>This site is designed to take you on a photo journey of some of the travels of James Wilson.  Born in a small town of Palmyra Missouri.  He joined the Air Force to be able to experience more of life than just corn fields.  Working as an aircraft mechanic he has gotten to travel quite extensively.  The pages listed here will be a small segment of some of the travels.</p>
      <p>Some of my hobbies include traveling, hiking, photography, and video games.  Last year I bought a Fuji XT-3 camera.  I have been liking it so far.  Having manual knobs and dials is a lot of fun in my opinion.  I also like aps-c vs full frame for weight/size of lenses.  When traveling/hiking I donâ€™t want to be carrying 20 pounds of gear.</p>
